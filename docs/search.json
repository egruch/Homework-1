    "text": "Being a Data Scientist\n\nWhat do you think being a data scientist is about?\nI find Data Scientist to be a very broad term, which include wrangling data, performing analysis, modeling data, and communicating data. This requires a combination of statistical knowledge, programming practice, and an understanding of the business/domain.\nWhat differences/similarities do you see between data scientists and statisticians?\nThe primary difference I see between data scientist and statisticians is audience. Data scientist are often business centric while statisticians are more research focus. However, both have the overwhelming goal of understanding the data. A statistician might achieve this by finding a model or distribution to understand the underlying population of the data. A data scientist could work to create a model that uses the data to make immediate or long term decisions.\nHow do you view yourself in relation to these two areas?\nThe role of a statistician more closely relates to the theory knowledge I have studied during my master; however, it feels very research focus which I consider myself more novice in. Data science relates more closely to the work I did in industry before my master, which included data management and data visualization."
