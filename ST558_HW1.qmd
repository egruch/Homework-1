## Being a Data Scientist

  ∗ What do you think being a data scientist is about? 
  
  ∗ What differences/similarities do you see between data scientists and statisticians? 
  
  ∗ How do you view yourself in relation to these two areas?

## Running Code

```{r}
y <- density(iris$Petal.Width)
class(y) #class of y
typeof(y) #type of y
str(y) #structure of y

```



```{r}
#| echo: false
plot(y$x, y$y, main = "Density of Iris Petal Width", ylab = "Estimated Desnity Values", xlab = "Coordinates")
```

The `echo: false` option is on which prevents the printing of code. The plot shows the estimated density values of the iris petal width.
